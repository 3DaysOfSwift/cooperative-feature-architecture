# Apps Made with CFA

These open-source iOS projects are the practical companion to the CFA
specification. They are not templates to copy blindly: each has a product
purpose and a different point in its architectural journey. Read them to see
how the same ownership rules appear in working application code.

| Project | CFA relationship | Repository |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cuentiva | Created using CFA | [Open Cuentiva](https://github.com/3DaysOfSwift/Cuentiva) |
| Personal API iOS App | Created using CFA and Swift Concurrency | [Open Personal API iOS App](https://github.com/3DaysOfSwift/Personal-API-iOS-App-Swift-Concurrency-CFA) |
| Trend iOS App | Created using CFA and Swift Concurrency; a broad reference for feature ownership and the AppModel composition root | [Open Trend](https://github.com/3DaysOfSwift/Trend-iOS-App-Swift-Concurrency-CFA) |
| RocketLaunch iOS App | Created using CFA and Swift Concurrency | [Open RocketLaunch](https://github.com/3DaysOfSwift/RocketLaunch-iOS-App-Swift-Concurrency) |
| Metro Mate iOS | An open-source application migrated into CFA and Swift Concurrency | [Open Metro Mate](https://github.com/3DaysOfSwift/metro-mate-ios) |

## How to use these projects

- **Starting a new app:** use CFA App Creation, then compare a small complete
  feature with the same boundaries in one of the reference projects.
- **Adding a feature:** follow the existing app's Feature Manager, repository,
  ViewModel and AppModel wiring rather than placing business rules in a View.
- **Migrating legacy code:** use Metro Mate as evidence that the Legacy GCD
  migration workflow changes architecture and concurrency in deliberate passes,
  while preserving the application's behaviour.
- **Reviewing a project:** run Xcode Project Dashboard locally, then inspect the
  source behind each finding. A dashboard report is evidence to investigate,
  not an automatic proof of correctness.

Each repository has its own README, deployment target, dependencies, test state
and product decisions. CFA provides common ownership and maintenance principles;
it does not require every app to have identical features or implementation
details.
