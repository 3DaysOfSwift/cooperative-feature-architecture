# CFA unit tests

Read the [CFA specification](references/cfa-specification.md), [product
behaviour contract](references/product-behaviour-contract.md) and [Swift coding
guide](references/swift-coding-guide.md). Keep production decisions in Feature
Managers and presentation state in ViewModels; never move a business rule into
a ViewModel merely to make it easier to test.

For a review-only request, inventory and report without editing. For a writing
request, first establish the current test result and map real behaviour to
tests. Do not create tests that only prove stored values can be read back from a
struct or that an object can be constructed.

Organise a test tree that exposes the application design:

```text
<App>Tests/
├── AppModelTests/
├── ViewModelTests/       # one named file for each production ViewModel
├── FeatureTests/<Feature>/
├── ConcurrencyTests/<Feature>/
├── PersistenceTests/
├── IntegrationTests/
└── Support/
```

For each public Feature API operation and meaningful ViewModel behaviour,
consider applicable success, validation/boundary, failure/retry, duplicate,
cancellation and overlapping-operation scenarios. Assert observable results,
state transitions and side effects rather than private implementation details.
Use injected repositories, clocks, clients and controllable continuations; do
not use live services, arbitrary sleeps or scheduler luck.

Build AppModel tests from an isolated dependency graph. Do not call production
`AppModel.shared` from a unit test. Give each production ViewModel a matching
test file and test what its View can observe: loading/ready/error states,
actions, drafts, selection and asynchronous results.

When auditing quality, report separately:

- executed passed, failed, skipped and unexecuted test counts;
- behaviour/scenario coverage, distinct from line coverage;
- tests with no meaningful asserted behaviour; and
- named missing scenarios, with source evidence and why they matter.

Run focused tests and then the appropriate full suite. State target, simulator
or device, runner result and any unavailable validation honestly. Green tests
do not prove exhaustive coverage or race freedom.
