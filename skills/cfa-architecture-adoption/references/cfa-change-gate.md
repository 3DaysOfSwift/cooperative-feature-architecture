# CFA change gate

Use this gate before changing a CFA app. It is a short design pass and a final
structural review, not a line-by-line ceremony.

## Before implementation

Write down the affected route for every screen in scope:

```text
Screen View → Screen ViewModel → AppModel.shared feature → provider / storage
```

For every proposed new or changed type, state: “This type owns …”. Confirm that
the responsibility is not already owned by an existing type.

Preserve these CFA invariants unless the developer explicitly asks to change
the architecture:

1. Every screen-level View has one adjacent, dedicated ViewModel created by the
   View with `@State`.
2. Each ViewModel defaults its narrow live feature dependency from
   `AppModel.shared`, while tests can provide an isolated replacement.
3. Screen View initializers do not receive AppModel, feature managers,
   repositories or ViewModels.
4. `ThemeManager` is an app-wide presentation dependency supplied through the
   SwiftUI environment. AppModel and feature managers are not environment
   values.
5. Feature managers own feature state and behaviour; ViewModels own screen
   presentation state and route user intent to their feature.
6. RootTabView is structural only. It presents tabs and navigation; it does not
   refresh features, interpret feature failures, or own feature loading state.
7. Every AppModel property, ViewModel dependency, initializer label, and local
   reference that represents a CFA feature ends in `Feature`. Reserve `Manager`
   for concrete implementation type names such as `SettingsManager`.
8. API operations return domain data or throw. Feature managers keep domain
   data, operation state and retained errors as separate values; no result-like
   `LoadState` enum may carry all three.
9. Application launch begins at the application lifecycle boundary. AppModel's
   `applicationDidFinishLaunching()` uses a Boolean guard and awaits feature
   refreshes without storing a Task handle. A screen `.task` is only for
   intentionally screen-lifetime-bound work.
10. A non-trivial SwiftData repository is a `@ModelActor`. Its `ModelContext`
    and SwiftData records stay inside that actor; it returns `Sendable` domain
    values to the main-actor concrete feature-manager type.
11. Views remain declarative. Bundle/system reads and presentation formatting
    belong to the adjacent ViewModel; business, persistence, and shared state
    belong to the owning FeatureManager.
12. A ViewModel initializer accepts only its narrow FeatureManager, defaulted
    from `AppModel.shared`. UI data is exposed by that feature and read through
    the ViewModel; do not add convenience initializer parameters.
13. Each local data responsibility uses the simplest single persistence route.
    A replaceable remote snapshot uses one JSON cache; SwiftData is reserved
    for genuinely structured, queryable, growing, or relational local data.
    Do not persist the same snapshot through both a database and a file cache.

## Before delivery

Review the changed source as one feature slice, not as isolated files.

- Trace every affected screen to its ViewModel and default AppModel feature.
- Confirm that no screen initializer gained dependency plumbing.
- Inspect every newly created or moved Swift file for the imports required by
  its own declarations; imports in another source file do not satisfy this.
- Confirm that every new screen and feature has the appropriate named
  test file under View Model Tests and Feature Tests.
- Confirm that launch refresh logic is absent from RootTabView and feature
  screens do not use `.task` as a substitute for application launch.
- Confirm that cached domain data remains representable while a refresh runs or
  fails, and that AppModel feature properties retain the `Feature` suffix.
- Confirm that storage work does not leak SwiftData `@Model` objects across an
  actor boundary, and that a `@ModelActor` is used where database work is not
  deliberately small and UI-owned.
- Remove abandoned files, duplicate state owners, placeholder naming and
  speculative abstractions created during the change.
- Build and run focused tests when available. Report an unavailable runtime or
  toolchain honestly; do not turn missing verification into a pass.

If any invariant fails, correct the plan before expanding the implementation.
