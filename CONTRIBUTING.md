# Contributing

Keep CFA easy to understand. Discuss changes to architecture principles separately
from bug fixes to the scanner or installer. Preserve the distinction between source
inventory, reviewed judgments and runtime evidence.

The canonical specification is `architecture/cfa-specification.md`. Tool source is
`tools/architecture-dashboard`. Never edit their generated skill copies directly.
Run `npm run sync`, `npm run validate` and `npm test` before proposing a change.
The bundled dependency copies are committed so a source checkout remains complete;
validation detects drift.

Add regression tests for observable behaviour, especially packaging portability,
non-destructive installation and report escaping. Do not add third-party dependencies
without a concrete need. Keep examples synthetic; reports from private apps do not
belong in the repository.

Report a bug with the toolkit version, Node/host versions, minimal reproducer and
expected behaviour. Do not paste secrets or private source. Use the repository’s
security reporting facility for private vulnerability reports once hosting is enabled.

Contributions are distributed under the repository’s MIT licence. Maintainers review
changes before releases; automatic scores are not an approval decision.
